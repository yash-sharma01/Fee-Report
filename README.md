Brief Description:
Fee Report System is a small application for maintaining a student's fee record by an accountant.
The application is developed on NetBeans IDE with the help of Glassfish Server. Technologies used in this application are:
1. HTML, CSS for building web pages.
2. Servlet for making the application dynamic and robust.
3. Apache Derby for storing data into a database.

There are 2 users of this application, the admin and the accountant. The admin manages information about the accountant, whereas the accountant keeps a record of students.

The application consist of 3 HTML pages, 18 Servlets and 1 CSS file. The front page has the login option for the admin or the accountant.
After logging in as admin, you can add accountants, view their contact information like their email, contact no, etc. The admin can edit and delete an accountant and its information. Now the admin needs to logout from the application.

If you login as an accountant, you can view all the students and their details such as roll no, name, email, course they opted, fee paid, etc. If a new student enrols, the accountant can add his/her details in the database by using add student feature. Rather than this the accountant can also edit or delete a student’s record.

The use of Servlets makes the web application Dynamic, Portable, Robust and Secure.

The application is developed for maintaining student’s information in schools, colleges, and coaching. The user interface is very simple, so that the user can easily interact with the application and complete his task.
